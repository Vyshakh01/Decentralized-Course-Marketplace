# Decentralized Course Marketplace

## Overview
**Decentralized Course Marketplace** is a blockchain-based platform for buying and selling educational courses. This platform leverages the power of decentralized networks to ensure secure, transparent, and trustless transactions between course creators and students.

## Features
- **Decentralized Platform**: Built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated and secure transactions between course providers and buyers using Solidity.
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions and ownership of courses are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
- **Buy and Sell Courses**: Users can list their courses for sale or browse and purchase available courses.
- **Payment Gateway**: Accepts cryptocurrency payments for seamless transactions.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React.js for the user interface.
- **Back-end**: Node.js (Express.js) for handling requests and API integration.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Solidity for smart contract development.
- **Database**: IPFS for decentralized file storage.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask for managing cryptocurrency transactions.
